Hello everybody. Thank you for coming today. I am a first year PhD student at the University of Queensland in the faculty of Medicine. Before I joined UQ, I was working at Monash in the department of Econometrics and Business Statistics and public health department. This body of work is driven by my working experience as statistics and econometrics tutor along with my colleague Emi Tanaka and Mitchell O'Hara-Wild.

## [Has this happened to you before?]{auto-animate="true"} 


Ideally, we could like to teach students read in a dataset and have a look at the strucure of the data.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
crabs <- read_csv("data/australian-crabs.csv") 
str(crabs)
```

- And many more unexpected <span style="color: red;"> errors</span>!

::: notes
I am sure many of the statistics and data sciences educators had experienced something similar before. When teaching first year data analysis and statistics units, we sometime unwillingly spent way to much time helping students with their coding problems and sometime event just installation issues. These precious time were taken away from actual courses materials delivering.

We present you with a self-paced R learning website. This website is designed for students with no experience in R and RStudio. 

[https://learnr.numbat.space](https://learnr.numbat.space)

:::

::: notes

This is an interactive introduction to data analysis with R. There are 9 chapters ordered from teaching students who to install R and RStudio to more advanced R programming skills such as data visualization and regressions. 

This project aims to help students with no programming experience to learn how to use RStudio at their own time and at their own pace.

- "Great teachers make it safe to be wrong. They build a Culture of Error that respects, normalizes,and values learning from errors." by Doug Lemov and Norman Atkins from Teach Like a Champion 2.0.  

- Studies^[Dalbey, J., and Linn, M. (1985),Deek, F. P., and McHugh, J. A. (1998), Hoffman & Angelo F. Elmi (2021)] have suggested that students learn more during debug session compared to error-free lecture. 


::: notes

As the statistical concepts are the focus of the subject, during lectures and tutorials, we normally implement an error-free classroom as we just cannot afford to spend too much time on teaching students debug. This valuable lesson of debugging wasn't incorporated in our daily teaching. As much as we want it to be an error free environment, it cannot be true as shown before.

::: notes
I joined R-Laides Melburne hen Covid happened. For amost two years, we could not have any in person event. I didn't get to meet the rest of the organisors for amost two years. But it didn't stop us developing our R skills. We continue to give women works in data science and statisticas opportunity to share their R knowledge with us. With zoom, we are able to have oversea attendees joining us and it really brought all the R-ladies around the world together.

As covid restrictions easing, we are able to have more in person events! Di continue to be a huge suppotor of R-ladies melbourne! Everyone found the talk on The workflow of tidy data, constructing plots and making data-driven decisions super beneficial.

we are called R-ladies but we do encourage other gender to attend our events.
